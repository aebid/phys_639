Introduction to Lab0

Make sure you are in an environment with ROOT

Lab 0's goal is to get everyone ready to use ROOT to save and manipulate data.
This is mostly done using TTrees, the goal with these two files is to
get everyone comfortable creating a TTree and reading the data

saveTree.C will create a file, and readTree.C will read it and make plots
These will hopefully help Lab0 go more smoothly

```root -l saveTree.C```

To quit root, use ```.q``` inside the interpreter

```root -l readTree.C```

Afterwords, you can look at the created image
