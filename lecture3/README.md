Introduction to Lab0

Make sure you are in an environment with ROOT

Lab 0 is to get everyone ready to use ROOT to save and manipulate data
This is mostly done using TTrees, the goal with these two files is to
get everyone comfortable creating a TTree and reading the data

saveTree.C will create a file, and readTree.C will read it and make plots
These will hopefully help Lab0 go more smoothly

```root -l saveTree.C```

To quit root, use ```.q``` inside the interpreter

```root -l readTree.C```

Afterwords, you can look at the created image
